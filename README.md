# NLP Midterm Project - Fake News Detection

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a fake news detection model using natural language processing (NLP). In today's information age, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news presents a significant challenge to society. Detecting fake news is crucial in preventing its negative impacts, such as influencing public opinion, fostering distrust, and sowing chaos. This project aims to address this issue by creating effective methods for identifying and combating fake news through NLP techniques.

## Problem Area
Fake news articles are deliberately crafted to deceive readers by presenting false information as factual news. Detecting such articles requires advanced language and statistical analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms. This project explores the patterns, differences, and features that distinguish fake news from genuine news using NLP techniques.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Dataset Creation: Gather a diverse dataset of news articles, including both true and fake news samples, for training and testing the fake news detection model.

2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: Cleanse and preprocess the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, tokenizing headlines, and eliminating stopwords. Extract word frequencies to capture patterns indicative of fake news.

3. Model Training and Evaluation: Utilize machine learning techniques, such as the Naive Bayes classifier, to train a fake news detection model on the labeled dataset. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

4. Important Feature Identification: Analyze the trained model to identify the most critical features or indicators of fake news, shedding light on characteristics associated with false information in headlines.

5. Model Deployment and Testing: Deploy the trained model as a fake news detection system and assess its performance on unseen news articles. Continuously monitor and fine-tune the model for improved accuracy.

## Dataset
The selected dataset for this fake news detection project is the ISOT Fake News dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of fake and real news articles, making it an ideal resource for training and evaluating fake news detection models. The dataset includes features such as title, text, subject, and date of publication. The dataset provides a valuable resource for addressing the challenges of identifying fake news.

## Evaluation Methodology
To ensure robust evaluation, this project employs precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. A confusion matrix is constructed to calculate these metrics, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the fake news detection system's performance. Comparisons with baseline accuracy are also conducted to gauge the model's effectiveness.

## Implementation
The implementation phase includes data cleaning, feature extraction, model training (Naive Bayes classifier), and evaluation. Data preprocessing involves removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, tokenizing headlines, and eliminating stopwords using the NLTK library. The top 1000 most common words serve as features for capturing patterns indicative of fake news. The Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the extracted features, achieving an accuracy of approximately 88%. The most informative features are identified, providing insights into characteristics associated with fake news.

## Results and Discussion
Analysis of the most informative features reveals intriguing words that influence the determination of whether a headline is true or fake. For example, words like "video," "racist," "lie," and "gop" are among the indicators of fake news. A word cloud visualization further illustrates these influential features. A confusion matrix enables the calculation of precision (90%), recall (86%), F1-score (88%), and accuracy (88.5%). The model surpasses the baseline accuracy of 50%, indicating its effectiveness.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project contributes to the field of NLP and fake news detection by providing insights, methodologies, and a trained model for identifying false information. While the model demonstrates promising performance, future work may explore deep learning models and fact-checking methods for further enhancements. Detecting fake news is essential for promoting truthful information and enabling informed decision-making in an era inundated with fake news.
